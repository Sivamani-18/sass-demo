# SASS Demo

SASS Demo is a minimal starting point for [Mindwave Demo](https://github.com/Sivamani-18/sass-demo.git) projects.

Once you have a local copy of this project to work from, make sure to install its dependencies with `npm install`. With Apostrophe installed, the first thing to do create an admin user account so you're able to log into the CMS. Run the following command (this will prompt you for a password).

```bash
node app.js apostrophe-users:add admin admin
```

Now you're all set! Just run `node app.js` to start up the local server and head to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.
